# Investigations of ChartJS

## JOURNAL

### 30.9.2022

- Switched vite+react to react-app and dropped typescript *snif* for now. But wierd problems solved. Using chartjs-react -plugin
- This is very in early stages. I wanted to use plain Chart -tag, but haven't got it work. Off cource I want to make this automagical as possible, but we will see.  
- Actually (don't give me up) I don't know much about react, but I learning everyday. Still miss Svelte etc.
- Adding this in github is because I need to see if and how this will work in production.
