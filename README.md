# Investigations of ChartJS

## JOURNAL

### 30.9.22

- Switched vite+react to react-app and dropped typescript *snif* for now. But wierd problems solved. Using chartjs-react -plugin
- This is very in early stages. I wanted to use plain Chart -tag, but haven't got it work. Off cource I want to make this automagical as possible, but we will see.  
- Actually (don't give me up) I don't know much about react, but I learning everyday. Still miss Svelte etc.
- Adding this in github is because I need to see if and how this will work in production.
  
### 1.10.22

- Added react-router -things for practise and some icons and about page about.. well now plugins/ addons we have.
- Added Octocat-corner to straight way to read this and everything else
- Charts... started (again) after sending this. Refactored thinking and etc.

### 4.10.22

- Started to make differend Charts. Problem to solve: Data is in json, one json-block is one chart. And chart's have differend chart-bases like Bar and Line etc. I dont' want to make to every chart theirs own queryes. Maeby I have to until I have non-gummy solution.
